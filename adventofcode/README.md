Advent Of Code solutions
========================

[adventofcode.com](http://adventofcode.com/) is a series of general programming puzzles crated by [Eric Wastl](https://twitter.com/ericwastl) that are being released one by day since Dec-01 2015, until Dec 25 (I guess).

I'm solving them all with no more than the Web Console and Javascript. I'm trying to use ES2015 features and as much functional programming as I can, while keeping the code readable.

## Run them

To try these scripts, go to the URL described at the top of the script and copy&paste the script into the console/scratchpad.

If you're using Firefox, you can use its [Developer Toolbar](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/GCLI#Opening_the_Developer_Toolbar) (`Shift+F2`) and `inject` the script passing the raw file URL from Github.

```
inject https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stefanmaric/scripts/master/adventofcode/day01.js
```
